# github-workflow

## 1. Project Scope

Our main goal this sprint is to develop a **simple, functional game web app** that users can interact with to play and receive instant feedback through a score system. The key deliverables for this sprint are: a playable game prototype, a clean and usable interface, and a functioning score display.

Key features:

- Game logic that runs smoothly

- A basic UI with start, play, and end screens

- A score system to show results

- Proper instructions for the user

Out of scope for now:

- Advanced styling and animations.

- User login and database setup.

- Deployment to production.

## 2. Milestones and Timeline
We’re syncing our tasks with the sessions:

- Game structure with Copilot session: We’ll finalize the game flow and plan the main logic/functions.

- Mid-sprint demo: We’re aiming to have a working prototype that we can show and take feedback on

- End of sprint: Fix bugs, improve the UI a bit, and do some internal testing

## 3. Team Roles and Responsibilities
(A) Reva :

- Writing and refining the game functions.

- Checking that the code is clear and readable.

- Taking notes during testing to track what needs improvement.

(B) Shivam:

- Creating the basic UI screens for the game.

- Helping test the game flow.

- Managing any merge conflicts during development.

(C) Naman(Me):

- Implementing the game logic using Copilot.

- Managing Trello to track our tasks.

- Preparing for the mid-sprint demo.

Our roles will stay the same for this sprint to keep things clear, but we will help each other if someone gets stuck.

Coordination:
We will have short daily standups on Discord, use GitHub issues for tracking bugs, and check in weekly to ensure we are on track.

## 4. Anticipated Challenges and Strategies
(A) Possible challenges:

- Handling merge conflicts when combining our code.

- Differences in coding styles.

- Managing Copilot suggestions without becoming too dependent.

- Balancing sprint work with our other academic tasks.

(B) Strategies to manage them:

- Use feature branches with clear commit messages and frequent merges to avoid large conflicts.

- Do pair programming and occasional code reviews to align coding practices and maintain consistency.

- Review, test, and document Copilot’s suggestions to ensure we understand and own the code.

- Maintain a shared calendar and limit task overload by planning realistic daily goals during standups.
